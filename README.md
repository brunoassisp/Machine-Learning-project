# Enron-ML-project (in construction :construction_worker:)
The **Enron Corporation**, once a major US company from the electric market, was involved in one of the biggest frauds ever seen. A lot of data related to **Enron** was made public, and posted to the web.

This dataset is composed by emails and detailed financial data that are typically confidential data.

This project was developed during the **Intro to Machine Learning** module of the **Data Analyst Nanodegree** course from [**Udacity**](http://udacity.com/) and it used **Enron's emails dataset**.

Take a look at my project! :yum:
